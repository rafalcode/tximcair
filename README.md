This repo
is a compendium of old "txim"i (text-on-image)
c programs, mpstly using ht the cairo library.

Famously I did one in Vigo as a farewell to a Mexican colleagueoand called txim or tximb or what ever


then at PV I refined alot of this work and included pango
also
so I want to take advantage of this

primarily I want to be able to create mp3 art for my various audio files.
this will just be plain images with relevant info on the track.

mpv coverart option wil allow this.
